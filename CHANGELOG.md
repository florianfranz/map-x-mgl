    - APP : 
      - Added a basic helper to 'fill' options object with defaults, with a priority for default over item with undefined or null values. This solves an issue in vt layer creation with some rules used for null value, where opacity was undefined, instead of the expected '1' value returned by the schema.

    - Solved issue with duplicated id in view legend #629 
    - Solved missing correct promise handling for view add/remove operation 
    - Added tests for 'chaos' handling : check that everything works as expected when a lot of views are added and removed in different order ( overlap in "on map" timing, very fast add/removal, etc ); 
    - Added events `view_ui_open` `view_ui_close` to have matching behaviour in the search tool when opening / closing a view. Ex. in search tool, the button should immediately switch, instead of waiting the layers of the view to be rendered.
    - Modified nested views list to handle better async callback with the fire method
    - Updated 'path' method: solved an issue when default was 'false'
  - APP/API
    - Add support for custom null values in stats : impacts vt style creator, auto-style, and all stat/source summary server side. Null values can be defined and will not be counted in reports. Such value will overwrite default null values, like empty string, null, etc.
    - Uploading a vector layer with an empty attributes table should not be possible ( #114 )

    - Update all examples; 
    - Upgraded jsdoc; 
    - Added support for generic mapbox-gl call. No limitation, but no guarantee that everything works. Use mapx specific methods if not sure. See basic example in src/js/sdk/examples/ex6/index.js
    - Added tests + documentation
    - Added example for 'common location' methods; 
    - Fix issue with wrong `mx_countries` table when requesting bbox

    - Update caniuse db
  - APP 
    - Allow sending unencrypted mail: Usefull to report errors of postgres ( which is used to encrypt mails).
    - Init theme as separate entry point, to get stuff done early. It should solve the issue when the server stops before loading initial style, e.g. DB is not working -> error message -> display modal : the style should be readyat this point. Link to the map object is done during the remaining js initialisation. Theme configurator inputs are built only when needed, after tools tab click.
    - Async views list translation
  - API/APP
    - Add common location tools : find bbox and map fit bounds based on iso3 code, m49 code or name + language. API and client side version. API version handle re-projection too.

  - Panels: changed orientation of handles to avoid obstructing scrollbar in some case

      - Initial search and subsequent fast search update, e.g. using the time slider, produced a large amount of requests. An async debounce has been added to prevent this.

    - Static mode : added button in legend's view title to open the metadata panel

      - Missing MapX app related text is automatically translated when building internal dictionary. Original dictionaries are not modified. Descriptions, abstracts, and any sensitive or contextual non-MapX text is not translated automatically. If a text has been translated, an asterisk is shown. A message describing this is also shown during language change. This has been done to mitigate the growing issue regarding the lack of contributions for our translation system for technical terms and templates. Contributions are welcome !

         - Geoserver Async call with email feedback for views and source update. All requests were blocking. It should be a lot faster now
         - Experimental shiny-server removal, as it was interfering with the docker logic when a process was failing. We rely on direct connexion. Traefik should ensure sticky connexion.

        - Source summary, allow all binnings method to have bounds from a single number in case of very skewed distribution (#596) ; 
    - APP
        - Better modal background : use pseudo-elements. It should avoid having modal siblings still accessible when background is set.
        - Added reverse mode in palette colors.
        - Set icon flash as a module using class. 
        - Added better click visual feedback on views panel - could be ported to the whole app.
        - Refactoring cache / fetch  management for wms and source summary:  
        - Unifiyng TTL and timeout (app side);
        - The button to remove cache has a confirmation step; It will remove all cache and stored data know to MapX. At least, what is accessible by  service workers and localforage; It does not trigger a reload anymore.
        - Source summary for views add a first step, no cached, to get source timestamp. This should avoid issues when the source is modified during a session. 
        - Partial rewrite of main dot templates: more flexibility to partial view UI loading. 
        - Filter tools are now generated only on demand. They need cached response of summary. Should be invalidated if the source or the view change.

   - Improvement
      - APP/API
        - Added application_name parameter in api and app. This parameter is usefull to perform request on DB `SELECT usename, application_name, state FROM pg_stat_activity`.
        - Removed references to a master connexion from the app : a single pool of connexion is used instead of two. Access to a master DB in case of DB clustering could still be made using `NO LOAD BALANCE` header in queries string.
        - Rewrote mapx specific wrappers around library pool functions.
        - Using onStop shiny function to launch cleaning steps should guarantee that no pool remains un-closed, and therefore avoiding memory leaks. Previous approach was made using the .Last command which is fired at the end of the R session. Maybe a combination of the two approaches could even be better.
